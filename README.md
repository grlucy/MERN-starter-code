# MERN Starter Code

This repo takes the MERN starter code provided by the University of Richmond Full Stack Bootcamp and adds the following dependencies:

- axios
- react-router-dom
- mongoose
- babel-plugin-transform-remove-console (Removes console.\*'s from production build)

Dependencies have also been audited to fix all security vulnerabilities.

.gitignore files have been added to the root and client directories.

## To Use:

1. Replace the app name (currently "groceries") in both package.json files, both package-lock.json files, and in manifest.json
2. Replace logo192.png and favicon.ico with your own icon art (Recommended icon generator: https://favicon.io/)
3. The code is now ready for you to add your own site content.
